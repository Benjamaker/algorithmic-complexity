## Algorithmic Complexity ##

A project to look at efficiency of operations and optimisation of algorithms.

## Project goals ##

- Write a timing framework to test the efficiency of algorithms with different sized input arrays.
- Test the efficiency of various built-in algorithms.
- Write my own version of these algorithms and experiment with optimisation.

### Getting started ###

`git clone git@github.com:Benjamaker/algorithmic-complexity.git`


### To run tests ###

`rspec`

### Algorithms to test ###

- Reverse
- Shuffle
